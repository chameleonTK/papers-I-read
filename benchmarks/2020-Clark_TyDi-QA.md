## [TyDi QA: A Benchmark for Information-Seeking Question Answering in Typologically Diverse Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05002)

A multilingual dataset in question answering task (include Thai). The key property of the dataset is that the question/answers here are not translated version of English so they could capture the more realistic style of people in that language. A model expects to have less accuracy on this dataset than translated datasets due to less trait of English that could be used as a hint for transfer learning.
